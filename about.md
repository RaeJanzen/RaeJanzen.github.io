### A little bit about me

<img align="right" width="300" margin-left="5px" src = "/assets/images/profile.jpg">
I am detail oriented with a strong and diligent work ethic. It is important to me that all work is done thoroughly and correctly. I have experience leading teams to accomplish assigned tasks as can be seen in my work experience with ARAMARK. Additionally, I spearheaded a student driven initiative to create personal connections between classmates in a remote learning environment by creating a discord server for the COGS Advanced Diploma grad class of 2021. I enjoy learning and challenging myself. This is demonstrated by the fact that I have researched PC building and have built two individual computers. In addition, I am a self-taught knitter with an interest in writing knitting patterns and have completed a few sweaters of my own design. I enjoy working in collaborative environments, but also thrive while working on self-contained projects.
